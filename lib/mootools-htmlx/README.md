MooTools HTMLX

This repository is for MooTools *contributors* that are not afraid to make new things. All users should download MooTools HTMLX from MooTools.net, but since it isn't offered there yet, you'll have to get it here - we know, that blows.

See the documentation files included in this repo. We don't have anything on the MooTools Wiki for you, because they rest of the group says HTMLX isn't *official* yet.
